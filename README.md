This repository contains practical **Java implementations of Design Patterns**, organized into three main categories:

- **Creational Patterns** – Object creation mechanisms (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder)
- **Structural Patterns** – Composition and structure of classes and objects (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Proxy)
- **Behavioral Patterns** – Communication between objects (e.g., Strategy, Observer, Command)

Perfect for interview prep, architecture design, and mastering object-oriented programming concepts.
